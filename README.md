A register form that uses javascript to demonstrate the use of setCustomValidity() function in a form. This function can be used to check the custom validation we need to add to the form like the password should be of minimum six lengths, the password and confirm password should be same, etc. If any of the condition is not satisfied the form shouldn't be submitted.
